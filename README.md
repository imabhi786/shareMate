Ever stuck in a dilemma when you are in urgent need of something but fail to get one. Well ! 'shareMate' does the job for you there !

## How to run
#### Pre-requisites
1. You need to have nodeJs(which usually comes with npm) installed in your pc. Follow the instructions on google.
2. To check whether node and npm is installed succesfully, open your terminal and enter :
```
$ node --version
$ npm --version
```
- node version > 6 and npm version > 5 are recommended.
#### Getting the repository
Inside your terminal, run :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vedanshagarwal4/shareMate.git
```

Then enter the project folder using :
```
$ cd shareMate
```
To install the required node modules, type :
```
$ npm install
```
#### Running the app
While inside the repo's base folder (shareMate), run :
```
$ node index.js
```
This would run the web server on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/).

Enjoy :)
